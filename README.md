vagrant-yacomas dev environment
===============================


Environment based on: https://github.com/sapienza/vagrant-php-box

Set up super fast a PHP5 development box with apache, mysql, phpmyadmin and whatever else that you may need


## How to run

  * Install vagrant using the installation instructions in the [Getting Started document](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/)
  * Clone this repository using git clone --recursive
  * run vagrant up
  * Go to http://localhost:8080/yacomas and enjoy!

PS: I receive several emails asking me which is the phpmyadmin's login and password, it is pretty easy to find out inside its docs... but, here it is:
login: root
password: root
